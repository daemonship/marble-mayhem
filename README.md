## What It Solves

Bullet heaven/survivors-like games are popular but often require downloads or have complex controls. There's a gap for an instantly playable, browser-based version with a humorous hook and simple upgrade progression.

Players who enjoy Vampire Survivors or Brotato but want a quick, no-install fix; fans of quirky, character-driven action games.

## Tech Stack
- Initialize repo structure and CI skeleton
- Core gameplay engine
- Progression system and upgrades
